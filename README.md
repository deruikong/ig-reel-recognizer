# Instagram Reel Recognizer

So basically, I spend too much time on reels... Sometimes there's a music that's just straight up jamming while I am doomscrolling, so I wrote this tool to help me find out the name of the music.

## Installation
Frontend:
```
npm install
```

Backend:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run: ``npm start`` then scan the QR code on your phone. Run ``flask --app index run --host=0.0.0.0`` to start the backend.

Note: change IP address in SearchResult.js to the IP address of your server.
